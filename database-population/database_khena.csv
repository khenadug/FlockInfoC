2,Characteristics of Bluetongue Virus,"Bluetongue viruses mainly causes abortions in the second half of pregnancy, but can also cause pregnancy loss in the first half, or occasionally death in neonatal lambs (2). Outbreaks are often seasonal as they are linked to when the midges are most active, which tends to late summer and autumn in Europe. Outbreaks are currently uncommon in the UK, but there is a significant risk of midges from mainland Europe reaching the UK in the future (3). The number of abortions caused by Bluetongue can vary depending on the strain. Ewes are normally unwell, with depression, drooling and potential difficulty breathing, and they may have swollen heads. Mouth and nose ulceration and lameness are common (4). Some lambs are born deformed. See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps to take following an abortion to reduce spread within the flock.",Expandable,1,,
3,Control,"The virus can be controlled by vaccination (5), insect control and biosecurity measures.  Vaccination should be undertaken before breeding, and before the high risk period when midges are active. Furthermore, care should be taken to use the vaccine which is specific to the strain of bluetongue in the area.",Expandable,1,,

Treatment: None, cull persistently infected animals as soon as possible
Notifiable Disease: No
Risk to Humans: No

Border Disease Virus (BDV, also sometimes known as ""Hairy Shaker Disease"") is similar to BVDV in cattle. BVDV can also be transmitted from cattle to sheep, and presents similarly to a sheep infected with BDV (1). These viruses are spread most efficiently by animals that are infected before birth and carry the disease for their whole lives, persistently infected or PI animals (2). This is how the disease is maintained in a flock. ",Button ,18," 68, 24",Causes
6,Characteristics of BDV,"Abortion is seen in mid to late pregnancy. If the infection is newly introduced in the flock, the number of abortions can be high. If the infection is already present, there tends to be a constant but lower level of abortion. The stage at which the ewe is infected with BDV (or BVDV) affects the outcome, which can include a high level of barren ewes, as the embryos are reabsorbed before scanning (3), abortion, stillbirths or live lambs. If lambs make it to full term, they grow 20% slower than uninfected lambs and either exhibit no symptoms or deformities, the most common of which are behavioural abnormalities and altered wool appearance (4). Either type of lamb can be persistently infected and transfer the virus to other sheep. The ewes do not present as sick.

See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion .

",Expandable,5,,
7,Control,"The virus can be controlled by blood testing the flock and removing infected individuals. Wherever possible, a closed flock should be maintained to prevent entry of the virus into the flock. Where this is not possible, new stock should be quarantined and blood tested for the virus before joining the flock (5). See biosecurity for more information on quarantining. ",Expandable,5,,
8,Vaccination,Vaccination of cattle on the same farm for Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) can reduce the transmission between cattle and sheep. Current evidence suggests that vaccinating sheep using a BVDV cattle vaccine does not help prevent BDV (6). ,Expandable,5,,

Samples for Diagnosis: Aborted placenta and lambs, blood from ewes, ram examinations, semen samples
Treatment: Not considered economical
Notifiable Disease: Yes
Risk to Humans: Yes (1) 

Brucella species can be spread between animals by bodily fluids like genital discharge and milk. They can also become infected by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated feed. In areas of the world where these bacteria are found they are a serious cause of abortion in sheep and goats (2), and a serious cause of human disease. ",Button,18,24,Causes
11,Characteristics of Brucellosis,"Brucellosis outbreaks are characterised by many abortions in late pregnancy. The aborted lambs tend to be decomposed, stillborn, or alive but weak. Depending on the type of Brucella, ewes may have a fever, be depressed, suffer from weight loss, mastitis, lameness or diarrhoea. Lambs can also be See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion to prevent spread within the flock and zoonoses (spreading to humans).  In rams it is characterised by testicular abnormalities like testicle enlargement, pain, hardening, epidydimal enlargement and decreased semen quality (3,4). It is commonly transmitted between ewes and rams during breeding.

Treatment: Seek veterinary advice
Notifiable Disease: No
Risk to Humans: Yes (1) 

Campylobacteriosis (formerly ovine vibriosis) is diagnosed in 9% of infectious abortion cases investigated in sheep in the UK (2). The infection is usually obtained from contaminated water or feed, from aborted materials or faeces from infected sheep. Birds, cattle and dogs have also been implicated in the transmission of these bacteria. ",Button,18,"24, 23, 38",Causes
15,Characteristics of Campylobacteriosis,"Infection of ewes can result in an ""abortion storm"" (high number of abortions) in late pregnancy (after 12 weeks), alongside the birth of stillborn or weak lambs that die shortly after birth. Aborted lambs tend to be well preserved. The ewes are usually well, but may show a mild diarrhoea (3). Outbreaks tend to last for one lambing season, and reoccur 4-7 years later, during the intervening years lower levels of abortion due to Campylobacter species may still be seen.

There is no vaccination commercially available in the UK for sheep, but in the case of an outbreak, consult your veterinarian as a vaccine can be imported on a license from the VMD. Note that there is emerging antibiotic resistance within some USA strains of Campylobacter jejuni (4). Sheep which have aborted due to Campylobacter should be isolated from pregnant sheep, as they will continue to shed the bacteria so can infect others. Pregnant sheep should also be kept away from any aborted material or lambs, as this is a major source of infection and can cause them to abort within 14-21 days (5).

26,Benefits of Reducing Losses,"Sheep and lamb losses are of major concern. Total lamb mortality is thought to be about 15% in UK flocks, but it has been shown to be anywhere between 1 and 43% depending on the farm and year (1). Of this, 30% are due to abortions, 49% is within the first 48hrs of being born, and an additional 11% is within the first 15 days of life (2). Therefore, the prevention of losses between scanning and weaning is important for health, welfare, productivity and viability of sheep flocks in the UK and across Europe.  

Animal Welfare
Reduced abortions and mortality mean a healthier, happier and more productive flock. There is an improved welfare for the ewes if they are not aborting the lambs, as abortion is often associated with poor health of the ewe. There have also been studies which have shown that ewes suffer emotionally when they lose a lamb (3).
?
A lower incidence of lamb mortality is a positive outcome for animal welfare as it indicates less lamb disease, starvation, hypothermia and other conditions which will cause suffering to the lamb. 

Economical/Financial

Each lamb which does not survive or is aborted costs the farm about £85 (4). For enzoonotic abortion alone, losses are estimated to cost £6-20 million yearly. Reducing the lamb mortality and abortion rates is expected to result in large cost efficiency gains (5). More large, healthy lambs can be sent to market, or sold as breeding stock. 

?
Emotional/Mental Health of Farmers
Losing livestock has also been shown to have a negative impact on the emotional wellbeing of the farmer (6). The death of a ewe or lambs born deformed can be particularly upsetting. A healthier flock with less death will result in a more positive lambing season for staff. 
?
Environmental Impact

The environmental impact of reduced abortion rates and lamb mortality is related to needing less ewes to produce more lambs. If more ewes birth and raise healthy, viable lambs, the flock size can theoretically be reduced while maintaining the same output. The mean carbon footprint has been calculated to be 10.85 to 17.86 kg CO2E/kg live weight finished lamb (7). The number of lambs raised per ewe (which is influenced by abortion and neonatal mortality) was identified as an important influence on the mean carbon footprint per finished lamb (7). Hence, reducing abortions and neonatal lamb mortality will decrease the carbon footprint of the lamb industry.

29,Contact with Other Livestock,"Double fencing boundary fences between fields where neighbouring farms have livestock reduces transmission of diseases by nose-to-nose contact or short distance aerial spread (1). Ideally there should be a 3m gap between the two fences to prevent direct contact (2). Either permanent or electric fencing are suitable. Note that this will not prevent the spread of insect or wind borne diseases e.g. Bluetongue.  

Do not share rams with other farms when possible. Ideally use home-bred rams or artificial insemination. ",Expandable,24,,
30,Buying in Livestock,"Buy in as few new animals as possible, however when buying in new stock is necessary, be careful about the source. Try to purchase animals from one known source with known health status. Get as much information as possible about the health history of that flock and vaccination history of the animals (3). Buy young stock, as older stock are more likely to be carrying disease. 

Quarantine new livestock for at least 3 weeks, keeping them away from other animals or handling facilities used for other livestock on the farm, unless these facilities can be disinfected between uses. Ideally keep bought in replacement ewes separate form the rest of the flock for at least one production cycle. This is particularly important for purchased pregnant animals, which should be kept separate from the existing flock until after lambing. Monitor these animals closely for signs of disease. Undertake testing of any animals with suspicious signs, especially any abortions. Disinfect or change boots, clothing and equipment when going between the new and existing flocks (4). 

Test new stock for diseases not present in the existing flock, especially those you particularly want to avoid bringing into the flock. Consult your vet and undertake testing in the existing flock to decide which tests should be prioritised. Common recommendations may include Enzootic Abortion of Ewes, Border Disease Virus and Maedi Visna, but other may be pertinent to your situation. 

Vaccinate new animals for diseases which are already present in the existing flock to ensure their vaccination status matches that of the rest of the flock. ",Expandable,24,,
31,Farm Visitors,"Provide disinfectant foot baths or clean boots and protective clothing for visitors to the farm, to prevent disease coming onto the farm from outside sources. 

Keep non-farm vehicles at the boundaries of the farm. 

Dispose of fallen stock, stillborn and aborted lambs quickly, safely and legally. The dead stock collection site should be away from healthy animals, and at the edge of the farm boundary (5). Ensure that other animals and scavengers cannot access the carcases. Covered bins are useful for temporary storage until dead stock can be collected, but they must be leakproof and be cleaned and disinfected regularly (6).",Expandable,24,,

33,Body Condition Scoring,"Studies have shown that not only does body condition score (BCS) have an impact on fertility, but also on the incidence of abortions. Ewes that are both too lean and too fat have higher losses during pregnancy (1). 
A constant supply of good quality forage should be supplied (either conserved or grazed). Extra feed should be supplied if needed, for example during late pregnancy, if forage is poor or for ewes carrying multiples. If feed is limited, livestock numbers should be reduced so the feed demand can be met. 

To ensure adequate nutrition of breeding and pregnant ewes:
*    ?Monitor ewe BCS before and after breeding, in mid pregnancy, before and after lambing and at weaning. The majority of ewes should be within the recommended BCS, see here for guidance (2).
*    Get forage analysed ahead of time to allow additional feeding to be sources before it is needed
*    Consult a nutritionist and/or vet to provide a pregnant ewe diet
*    Ensure there is enough space for all ewes to access food, recommendations vary depending on whether is feed is ad lib or limited, see here (page 32) for details (3). 
*    Blood sample ewes 3-4 weeks before lambing to check nutrition is appropriate",Button,21,,Controls

Also, deep clean the troughs after repair or maintenance, following possible contamination or when contamination levels are high (1). Portable water systems and IBCs should also be cleaned regularly. 

?Provide enough water for the whole flock, especially for pregnant ewes and when the weather is hot. 

Check natural water sources for growth of blue-green algae. It can be found in lakes, ponds, canals, reservoirs or any other water source (2).

To avoid midges, sheep can be housed overnight during periods of high midge activity. They should also be kept away from wet areas of farms where possible. Breeding of livestock can be delayed until the risk period is over. 

Ticks can be avoided by keeping livestock away from woodland and shrubs during high-risk periods. Tick habitat can also be removed from the field, e.g. by clearing bracken and draining wet land, where this is allowed.",Button,21,,Controls
43,Reduce Stress,"Keep the handling of pregnant sheep to a minimum. When handling is necessary use a  gentle and calm handling technique, using funnels, races and crates to minimise stress. Also keep the use of dogs to a minimum when working with pregnant ewes. 

Avoid transporting ewes within 2 weeks before lambing, 3 weeks if they are carrying multiple lambs (1). 

Where possible keep pregnant ewes away from areas where they may encounter pet dogs. Put up signage to inform dog walkers that there are sheep in the field and remind them that sheep worrying is illegal. Talking to dog owners may also be worthwhile. Wildlife attacks can be prevented by predator control, working with local gamekeepers, adding additional fencing or moving sheep to another area (2).

Provide shade or shelter in high temperatures to reduce heat stress. Also make sure there is access to fresh clean water. Keep a close eye on the flock for signs of heat stress on days when the temperature humidity index is high.

Provide windbreaks or shelter in windy or wet conditions.",Button,21,,Controls

45,Silage Contamination Control,"Sheep should not be fed visibly dirty, mouldy, discoloured, odd smelling or contaminated silage which may pose a disease risk. 

Soil and faecal contamination should be avoided when making silage. This can be done by:
- ensuring slurry applied to the fields has been taken up by the plant before harvesting
- setting the mower high enough to avoid it encountering soil
- making sure the wheels of all vehicles are clean before starting harvesting, baling or wrapping
- ensuring all equipment is clean of material from the previous harvest 
- removing stock from the pasture well before silage making, to avoid faecal contamination 
- rolling fields after winter
- keeping mole populations under control

Silage should be stored anaerobically (without air) to allow sufficient fermentation to take place, in order to drop the pH to acidic condition, and stop dangerous bacteria proliferating/breeding. This can be achieved by:
- rolling out all the air in the silage clamp, ensuring the shoulders are not missed
- covering the silage clamp with oxygen-proof plastic sheeting 
- using a secondary thick bird-proof sheet over the clamp
- weighing down the sheeting appropriately
- adding an additive can help speed up fermentation and decrease harmful pathogens which may be present (1)
- bales should be covered by 4 layers of plastic, more layers has not been proven to be beneficial (2) 
- regularly checking for punctures in the plastic covering the clamp or bales

When using silage, only uncover a little at a time, to keep air out as much as possible. Once the surface is exposed to air, the silage will deteriorate rapidly and soon be unsuitable to feed to animals, especially sheep. The edge of the sheet should be weighed down to prevent air getting under it. 

Silage testing should be undertaken before feeding it to livestock, to ensure it has fermented sufficiently, to assess the nutritional content, and check ash values. For grass silages, ash levels are usually between 6 and 8% (3). If ash levels are over 10%, this is an indicator of soil contamination, which may increase mould, yeast and bacteria growth which can be associated with disease e.g. listeriosis (4).

Treatment: Seek veterinary advice
Notifiable Disease: No
Risk to Humans: Yes (1,2)

Chlamydia abortus (Enzootic abortion of ewes, EAE, or Ovine Enzootic abortion, OEA) is the largest cause of abortion in sheep in the UK, accounting for 24% of infectious abortions (3). Ewes are commonly infected by exposure to aborted materials from an infected ewe during lambing time, and will then abort their next pregnancy. See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion to prevent spread within the flock and zoonoses (the infection spreading to humans).",Button,18,"68, 24",Causes
48,Characteristics of EAE,"When Chlamydia abortus is first introduced to a flock, a few abortions may be seen in the first year and, if no preventative measures are taken, high levels of abortion can be seen during late pregnancy (>100 days) of the following lambing. Lambs can be aborted preserved, decomposed, mummified, stillborn and born weak but alive. Litters of lambs can include a mixture of these. The affected ewes do not tend to be unwell.

For more information see SRUC. Enzootic Abortion of Ewes (EAE) 2020. Available from: https://www.sruc.ac.uk/media/mjjbxmvr/eae_insert_2020-1.pdf.",Expandable,47,,
49,Control,"EAE can be controlled by vaccination of replacement ewes before breeding, alongside biosecurity measures during lambing and not using female lambs that survive as replacement stock (4). Ongoing antibiotics use for management of enzootic abortion does not achieve the same level of control as vaccination and is not recommended when considering the responsible use of antibiotics (5,6). In the event of a large outbreak, consult your vet. 

For EAE-free flocks, new stock should be bought from EAE-free accredited flocks were possible and kept separate from the rest of the flock for the first one to two years. Also all abortions should be investigated and the results acted upon.

50,Vaccination,"Vaccination dramatically reduces abortion levels, but will not stop them altogether. Also, the live vaccines should not be used on farms that are EAE-free (7). The live vaccine (Cevac Chlamydia or Enzovax in the UK) should be administered at least 4 weeks before mating, it will not work on animals recently treated with certain antibiotics and should be treated with caution as it can cause disease in humans (8, 9). The inactivated vaccine (Inmeva in the UK), requires two doses in the first year, then annual boosters. The first dose should be given at least 5 weeks before mating and the second 3 weeks later. Booster vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks before mating. This vaccine can also be given during pregnancy, especially during the second trimester of pregnancy but not in the last month (10).",Expandable,47,,

52,Coxiella Burnetti (Q Fever),"Cause: Bacteria (Coxiella burnetti)
Distribution: Worldwide

Samples for Diagnosis: Aborted placenta and lambs, vaginal swabs, milk, faeces from ewes. Environmental/feedstuff testing
Treatment: Seek veterinary advice
Notifiable Disease: Yes
Risk to Humans: Yes (1) 

Q fever is transmitted between animals through bodily fluids and faeces. During normal lambings or abortion, a huge amount of Coxiella Burnetii bacteria are shed in the birth products of infected ewes. The bacteria can survive in the environment and when these products dry they can become an aerosol and are then spread by the wind and inhaled, or eaten. Ticks can also transmit the bacteria from an infected animal to a healthy one. The main concern is infection of humans through these routes. See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion to prevent spread within the flock and zoonoses (the infection spreading to humans).",Button,18,"24, 22, 68, 42, 38",Causes
53,Characteristics of Q Fever,"Abortion due to Q fever in sheep is generally sporadic, although abortion storms can occasionally occur in flocks where it has not been seen previously. Especially if an infected animal is brought in and lambs or aborts within the main flock, shedding high levels of bacteria into the surroundings. If the disease has been present in the flock for some time, there can continue to be low levels of abortion due to it (2). The abortions are late in the pregnancy, also some lambs from infected mothers will be stillborn or alive but weak. The ewes do not normally present as unwell, but there can be a higher chance of metritis (infection of the uterus) in these ewes. Diagnosis of Q fever may be difficult as C. burnetti bacteria may be present without being the primary cause of abortion, as they can be found in normal birth products of infected ewes. 

For more information on Q fever see OIE. Q Fever. Available from: https://www.oie.int/en/disease/q-fever/.",Expandable,52,,
54,Control,"The purpose of controlling Q fever is mostly to protect human health, as the clinical impact on sheep flocks is generally low. Control measures can include insect and vermin control, biosecurity measures and clean water. 
Specific control measures for flocks in which Q fever is a problem include:
- Keeping pregnant and young animals away from those giving birth and any birth products
- Keeping pregnant and young animals upwind of lambing ewes or kidding goats
- Keeping lambing ewes indoors with carefully controlled airflow
- Compost manure for at least 90 days before spreading on land, then spread on low wind days
- Minimise dust",Expandable,52,,
55,Vaccination,"In the event of an outbreak, your veterinarian may be able to apply for a special import licence for the vaccine from Europe, as it is not currently commercially available in the UK (3). However, despite vaccination, ewes which are infected before being vaccinated will continue to shed some bacteria during the next lambing season (4).",Expandable,52,,

E. coli is found widely in the environment, as well as the gut, and in faeces. However, it can also be a cause of abortion if ewes become infected. Infection commonly occurs when the bacteria is eaten. Care needs to be taken to avoid human infection by this bacteria.

Listeriosis is a bacterial infection often obtained from spoiled silage or soil contaminated pasture. The bacteria reproduce in silage contaminated with soil or faeces that is not stored appropriately.

Body Condition Score (BCS) is an indicator of the fat cover of the ewe. Both ewes that are too thin and too fat can have problems with fertility and increased risk of abortion (1). Both the quantity and quality of forage is important. Overstocking a field or having too little feed space in a shed can contribute to some sheep becoming too thin.",Button,18,"33, 40, 45",Causes
71,Undernutrition,"Undernutrition makes sheep more susceptible to other diseases. Underfed and thin ewes during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy are more likely to be barren due to lower fertility (2), reabsorb their embryos (3) and some may suffer later from abortions of mummified foetuses. Undernutrition during the second trimester can increase the chance of premature birth of weak lambs and further abortions. Ewes with a low BCS and undernutrition during the third trimester will produce small and weak lambs which are susceptible to disease and hypothermia. Studies have shown that nutrition during late pregnancy is most important in determining lamb birthweight (4), as well as colostrum quality and quantity.",Expandable,70,,
72,Iodine Deficiency,"Ewe diets that are deficient in iodine or high in goitrogens (compounds that interfere iodine uptake and use), such as brassicas and some legumes, can impact on lamb numbers and survival. Iodine deficiency during breeding and early pregnancy can result in reduced lamb numbers at scanning time. An iodine-deficient or goitrogen-high diet in the second half of pregnancy can result in late abortions, stillbirths or the birth of weak live lambs. Lambs characteristically have reduced hair cover and in severe cases may have a swelling on the lower neck.

Salmonella species are commonly found in healthy sheep in the UK. However, certain serotypes (Salmonella montevideo, S. dublin, S. diarizonae, S. typhimurium, S. abortusovis) can cause abortion (2). S. abortusovis is an important cause of abortion in other parts of the world, but is not currently seen in the UK. Other Salmonella species remain important in the UK, especially due to their potential to cause severe disease in humans. See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion to prevent spread within the flock and zoonoses (the infection spreading to humans).

These bacteria can be introduced to the flock by contaminated feed or water rodents and birds, or by the addition of infected animals to the flock. Outbreaks of disease due to salmonellosis are especially severe when sheep are housed, due to a higher stocking density and a greater potential for the bacteria to spread through water and feed troughs (3). Stress (e.g. transport, feed/water shortages, weather changes) can also initiate abortion storms due to these bacteria.",Button,18,"22, 23, 24, 38, 40, 45, 68",Causes
78,Characteristics of Salmonellosis,"Symptoms of infection with Salmonella species in sheep are diarrhoea, depression, not eating, and sometimes rapid death (4). When abortion occurs, it is usually seen during mid to late pregnancy.  Lambs can also be stillborn or alive but weak and suffer from diarrhoea, these lambs often die soon after birth. Ewes can also have retained placenta and/or vaginal discharge after aborting or giving birth to affected lambs.

The Schmallenerg Virus is a ruminant disease which is spread by midges and commonly causes abortion and the birth of deformed lambs.",Button,18,"42, 68",Causes
83,Characteristics of Schmallenberg Virus,"Schmallenberg can cause abortion during mid to late pregnancy. The number of ewes affected can be high if infected midges are present when most ewes are in early pregnancy, otherwise abortion numbers may be low. Ewes are not normally unwell. Each litter can have a mixture of normal, stillborn or deformed lambs (1). Deformations can be severe, with joints and the spine having abnormal angles. There may also be signs of brain damage. Even severely deformed lambs can be alive at birth and need to be euthanised promptly to prevent suffering. The deformities can cause problems during birth, making assistance or veterinary intervention necessary. Schmallenberg outbreaks can be particularly hard for farmers due to the high levels of losses (of both ewes and lambs), deformities and birthing troubles (2).

Stress can cause an increase in other diseases in the flock. Abortions are usually sporadic, and the ewes are not likely to be unwell. Abortions are most likely in response to stress during mid to late pregnancy. 

Murray et al 2019 reported that each incident of dog worrying has been shown to cause on average 0.34 pregnant ewes to abort per dog worrying incident (1). In May/June 2019, 14% of sheep farmers claimed that dogs had attacked or chased their flock in the last 12 months. These farmers had an average of 3.5 incidents per year. These figures show that dog worrying is a real cause of abortion in ewes. 

By comparison, predator attacks by animals like foxes, large birds or badgers are also associated with abortion in ewes. Each incident is thought to cause 0.15 pregnant ewes to abort, on average (1). 37% of sheep farmers reported wildlife attacks in their flocks when asked about the incidence of attacks in the 12 months preceding when the questionnaire was conducted (May/June 2019). The average number of attacks reported was 9.4 incidents a year. 

Heavily pregnant ewes may abort if transported, handled or herded during late pregnancy as these events are stressful, especially if done in a rough or rushed manner. Sheep dogs should be used sparingly when moving pregnant ewes. 

Heat stress has been shown to cause decreased fertility of ewes, early embryo losses, impaired foetal growth and increased lamb mortality. The impact of heat stress is thought to be most profound at temperatures above 25-31°C (2). There are various mechanisms by which this happens, one is ewes eating less when under heat stress. This lowered feed intake affects the ability to maintain a pregnancy and foetal development (3).

89,Tickborne Fever,"Cause: Bacteria (Anaplasma phagocytophilum)
Distribution: Europe, similar diseases seen in other continents
Source: Ticks (ixodes ricinus - the common sheep tick), shared needles
Samples for Diagnosis: Aborted placenta and lambs, blood samples from ewes
Treatment: Seek veterinary advice
Notifiable Disease: No
Risk to Humans: Yes (1)

Sheep can become infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilium when they are bitten by infected ixodes ricinus ticks, the common sheep tick. The bacteria can also be transmitted from infected sheep to their flock-mates through reused needles. The resulting disease, tickborne fever, is typically seen in lambs in spring and summer when sheep are moved from areas with low numbers of ticks to areas where there are many. Symptoms normally start to show 1-2 weeks after infection, and last approximately 2 weeks, although subsequent relapses are possible.",Button,18,42,Causes
90,Characteristics of Tickborne Fever,"Symptoms include fever, depression, weight loss and sometimes a cough. If ewes are exposed to infected ticks for the first-time during pregnancy, abortion of the lambs may occur. Abortion tends to occur 2-8 days after the onset of the fever (2). It is unclear if tickborne fever can also result in the birth of stillborn or weak live lambs (3). Tickborne fever affects the animals' immune system, and can make them more susceptible to other diseases, including tick pyaemia, louping ill, listeriosis and pneumonic pasteurellosis.

93,Toxoplasma Gondii,"Cause: Protozoal parasite (Toxoplasma gondii)
Distribution: Worldwide
Source: Young cats, feed/forage contaminated by cat faeces
Samples for Diagnosis: Aborted placenta and lambs, blood samples from ewes
Treatment: Seek veterinary advice
Notifiable Disease: No
Risk to Humans: Yes, from cat faeces (1)

Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite which causes toxoplasmosis. It is transmitted by cats. Cats shed a high number of parasite oocysts ('eggs') in their faeces when they are young and first start hunting, they pick up the infection from rodents. Cats rarely present as unwell (2). If the cat defecates on pasture, forage, concentrate feed or into a sheep water source, sheep can ingest the oocysts, and they only need to eat a few 10s of oocysts to cause pregnancy loss or abortion. The oocysts can remain in the soil for up to 18 months, and in a water supply for up to 4.5 years (3).",Button,18,"22, 35, 38, 40, 68",Causes
94,Characteristics of Toxoplasmosis,"If the disease is introduced to a farm while ewes are pregnant, there can be a high barren ewe rate and/or many abortions. If the disease is already present, it may cause a constant low level of abortions every year. The ewes do not present as unwell. Toxoplasmosis can cause abortion of mummified or decomposed lambs, stillbirths and the birth of live weak lambs (4). One ewe can produce a mixture of these outcomes within one litter of lambs.

95,Control,"Toxoplasmosis can be controlled by vaccination, managing cats appropriately, vermin control, providing clean water and avoiding feed contamination. Aborted material should be cleared away rapidly to prevent cats or vermin eating it, and being infected by the parasite. See Abortions - What to do? for immediate steps which should be undertaken following an abortion to prevent spread within the flock and zoonoses (infection of humans).",Expandable,93,,
96,Vaccination,"There is a vaccination available (Toxovax in the UK). Replacement/first time breeding ewes should be vaccinated with a single dose between 3 weeks and 4 months before breeding, provided they are over 5 months of age. Revaccination after 2 years is recommended by the manufacturer, at least 3 weeks before breeding. This vaccine cannot be used in pregnant ewes and should not be administered by anybody who is immunocompromised or pregnant (5).",Expandable,93,,
